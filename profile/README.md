# Welcome to the Free and Open Source Software Club at Jyothi Engineering College ðŸ‘‹

At the FOSS@JECC, we aim to create a friendly environment for members of all knowledge and skill levels to explore the world of free and open source technology and software. Whether you're a computer science/engineering major and want to find a community to develop software with, or you just want to learn more about free and open source software and how to use it, you've come to the right place.

Although the club is mostly CS focused, it is not required for you to be a CS/ECE major to join, or for you to have any previous experience with free and open source software. All you need is an interest in learning more!
